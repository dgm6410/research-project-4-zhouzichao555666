Hi everyone
    
    This week I main research using AQUAS to create a wonderful water effect with Gaia and CTS.
    
    I edit a basic AQUAS using operation. THe link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NqyJYbd9WhTG2kKedMRR-_WjawhinHo6LNzAAXwdO8/edit?usp=sharing
   
   My research project is too big to upload the github, I do not have enough space to store it 
    in my google drive. If you want the project file, please contact me!
